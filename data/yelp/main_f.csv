We got 2 Vegetarian Dim Sum Platters, each of which included 2 of the Buddha Delight Dumplings (green pea on top), Mixed Mushroom Dumplings (purple skin), Bamboo Shoot Dumplings (open top), and another. These were definitely very wholesome and designed carefully with a mind for fillings, but they were all quite bland and the tasteless sticky rice got tiring. The purple Mixed Mushroom Dumplings were our favorite because they were more meaty and juicy. We also got Sweet Sesame Balls which were great.', 'creator': None, 'images': [], 'review_date': '11/26/2022', 'stars': None}, {'content': ""The dim sum is good and service is stellar, but I'm giving 5 stars for the mapo tofu dish.

They were all delicious so I wasn't that upset about the higher price haha. Wontons were crunchy and filling was creamy with a hint of pineapple. Bbq pork to bun ratio was perfect and the bbq flavor was very tasty. Pan fried dumpling had a nice crispness on the outside and filling was also tasty.
